        <p>
          4Bytes is a super easy, light-weight PHP framework.
          It isn't really object-oriented, it doesn't have to be.<br/><br/>
          If you have a small project that requires PHP, 4bytes could be the ketchup to your hotdog.

        <h3>About 4Bytes Framework</h3>
        <hr/>

        <p>
          4Bytes is designed to be easy, and fast to develop with.<br/>
          It comes with Twitter Bootstrap so you can start developing as soon as you download 4bytes.<br/>
        </p>

        <p>
          The main goal of 4Bytes is speed. Nothing is more frustrating, especially to a new PHP developer,
          than trying to learn a complex framework
          <b>on top of</b> learning PHP.
          With the 4Bytes Framework, you get a really powerful system, all while having it be really easy to learn.<br/>
          The learning curve is about 20 minutes.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <p>
          To learn 4bytes, just check out the /public/index.php file. You will be able to follow the code from there.
          4bytes is similar to other MVC frameworks, although it is less strict.
        </p>

        <p>
          Benefits of using 4bytes Framework:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You'll be a better programmer. 4bytes doesn't give you too much. It gives you just enough to let you quickly
            build applications, but you still have to know a lot of PHP.
          </li>
          <li>
            It's fast. Really fast. In fact, if you don't enable the DB connection, it might be one of the fastest frameworks,
            and it uses almost no memory. 4bytes doesn't come with bloated classes and complicated structures, it's all pretty simple.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fast. Did I mention the fast development? If you need to whip up a site in a jiffy, 4bytes comes loaded with
            Twitter Bootstrap and jQuery.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zero config. You literally don't have to change anything in order to use the framework. Granted, you should change some of the settings
            to match your project settings, but you don't have to.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Routes define what should happen at a given URL. Create a route that points to the controller and method you want to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Controllers are the pieces that actually return HTML. You can actually return anything, JSON or XML would be valid.
          </li>
          <li>
            URL arguments are anything in the URL that is not the controller or method. Example: the URL /blog/view would call the "blog" controller and the "view" method.
          </li>
          <li>
            Layouts are HTML files that should contain the &lt;html&gt; tags and header information. Views are smaller pieces of HTLM that should be reusable.
          </li>
          <li>
            Includes are miscellaneous files that you can include in your project. If you need to include some classes or functions put the file in the includes folder and include the file in the includes.php file.
          </li>
        </ul>
