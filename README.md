## 4Bytes Framework
**The 4bytes Framework is one of the simplest, and fastest PHP frameworks that exist today. It is very easy to learn, and is a great framework for beginners, or someone who wants a very easy-to-maintain website.**

4bytes is quick to develop with, easy to grasp, and easy to extend.

4bytes *does not* have a lot of features, all the documentation you could possible need is located in the code, and the README files.

***

Amazing features of the 4bytes Framework:

 - Database abstraction with PDO
 - Secure cookie handling with encryption and value validation
 - Simple regex routing system to create dynamic URLs
 - Simple ways to print blocks of HTML (`layout()`, `block()`, `view()`)
 - Simple controllers, no abstract classes or other pointless OOP
 - Helpful static classes like `HTML`, `Cookie`, `Session`, and `JSON_DB`
 - Easy to contribute to, just fork and add some useful helpers
 - *Seriously, no pointless OOP, there is no need to complicate this*
