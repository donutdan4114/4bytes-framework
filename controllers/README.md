## Controllers
**Classes that handle HTTP requests.**

Controllers should contain a class with a name of:
`__NAME__Controller` where `__NAME__` is the name of your controller file capitalized.

For example, a controller in *controllers/about.php* should have a class inside called `AboutController`.

So your file should look like:
```
<?php

  class AboutController{

    // Methods go in here.

  }
```
